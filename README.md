Application that finds the similarities between two documents by comparing substrings.
We compare using brute force, comparing hash strings, and comparing hash codes.
All code is optimized for increased performance.
The only file given to us initially was HashFunction.java.

Personally worked on each of the following files:
* HashCodeSimilarity
* HashSimilarity (interface)
* HashStringSimilarity
* HashTable
* Main (testing)
* Similarity (interface)
* TuperIterator
